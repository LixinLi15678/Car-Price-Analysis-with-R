# Car Price and Interior Analysis with R

## Project Overview
This project, conducted as part of MAT374, focuses on the analysis of car prices and interiors using R. By examining a dataset obtained from Kaggle, the study investigates the relationships between various car attributes and their impact on car price and the presence of leather interiors.

## Dataset
The dataset includes 16 variables related to car attributes, out of which 8 were used for analysis. Key variables include Levy, Engine Volume, Mileage, Gear Box Type, Airbags, Price, Production Year, and Leather Interior.

## Research Questions
1. Can we predict the car price based on attributes such as levy, engine volume, mileage, gearbox type, and the number of airbags?
2. Can we predict whether a car has a leather interior based on price, levy, production year, engine volume, mileage, and the number of airbags?

## Methodology
The analysis consists of two main parts:
- **Regression Analysis**: To predict car price using variables such as levy, engine volume, mileage, etc. Techniques used include Linear Regression and Ridge Regression.
- **Classification Analysis**: To predict the presence of a leather interior using logistic regression, LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis), and QDA (Quadratic Discriminant Analysis).

## Results
The results section discusses the findings from both regression and classification analyses, including model performance and error rates.

## Conclusions
The study concludes with insights on significant predictors for car price and the presence of a leather interior, providing valuable information for potential car buyers.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have R and the necessary packages installed.
3. Run the analysis scripts to reproduce the findings or apply the methodology to your own dataset.
